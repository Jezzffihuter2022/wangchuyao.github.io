Welcome! I study how algorithmic systems and digital infrastructures shape public reasoning, trust, and political legitimacy, using computational and experimental methods. 

I am a PhD researcher in Social Research Methods at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), affiliated with the LSE Data Science Institute. I will be a Visiting Assistant in Research at Yale University's Department of Political Science.  Please see my CV [here](/files/ChuyaoWANG_LSE_CV.pdf)

**I am on the job market for Assistant Professor and postdoctoral positions starting in 2026.**

I have authored 8 papers, including publications, manuscripts under review, and works in progress for leading interdisciplinary and political communication journals. These includes my [job market paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16202) under review at *Nature Communications*, and a [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-04350-1) in *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications* (Nature Portfolio).

As Principal Investigator, I have secured competitive grants from LSE, OpenAI, Google, and Social Science Research Council (USA). I am committed to excellence in teaching, mentorship, and service, particularly in advancing innovative, interdisciplinary and impactful scholarship.

I obtained an MPhil in Social Science (full funded) and an MSc in Global China Studies (with Dean's Award) from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I hold BA in History (Economic History) from Shandong University (SDU).
