Welcome! I study how algorithmic systems and digital infrastructures shape public reasoning, trust, and political legitimacy, using computational and experimental methods. I am a PhD researcher in Social Research Methods at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), affiliated with the LSE Data Science Institute. I will be a Visiting Assistant in Research at Yale University's Department of Political Science.  Please see and download my [Full CV](/files/ChuyaoWANG_LSE_CV.pdf)

**I am on the job market for Assistant Professor and postdoctoral positions starting in 2026.**

**Substantively**, I explore how political institutions and algorithmic technologies jointly shape public reasoning, trust, and policy legitimacy. I focus on phenomena such as AI labeling, LLM sycophancy, and human–AI interaction in policy and communication settings.
**Methodologically**, I integrate survey and field experiments with computational approaches—particularly language model–driven simulations and text/image analysis—to examine causal mechanisms and heterogeneous treatment effects in public opinion and digital governance.

I have authored eight research papers, including a publication in *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications* (Nature Portfolio). My manuscripts are currently under review at *Nature Communications*, *Technology in Society*, and *International Journal of Press/Politics*, with additional work in progress for *Nature Human Behaviour*.  
My current project investigates how human–AI feedback loops influence public opinion formation and policy support.

As Principal Investigator, I have secured competitive grants from LSE, OpenAI, Google, and Social Science Research Council (USA). I am committed to excellence in teaching, mentorship, and service, particularly in advancing innovative, interdisciplinary and impactful scholarship.

I obtained an MPhil in Social Science (full funded) and an MSc in Global China Studies (with Dean's Award) from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). I hold BA in History (Economic History) from Shandong University (SDU).
