I am a PhD researcher in the Department of Methodology at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), affiliated with the LSE Data Science Institute. I will be a Visiting Assistant in Research at Yale University's Department of Political Science in 2025.

**I am on the job market for Assistant Professor and postdoctoral positions starting in 2026.**

## Overview

My research examines:
- AI governance and policy
- Political communication in the digital age
- Computational social science methods
- Applications of AI in social sciences
- Human-AI interaction and its sociopolitical impacts

My 8 research papers include publications in *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications* (Nature Portfolio), with manuscripts under review at *Nature Communications*, *Technology in Society*, and *PNAS Nexus*, and work in progress for *Nature Human Behaviour*.

As Principal Investigator, I have secured competitive grants from LSE, OpenAI, and Google. I am committed to excellence in research, teaching, and service.

## Current Projects

My current work investigates how AI systems shape public opinion and policy support, focusing on human-AI feedback loops. I employ survey experiments, computational text analysis, applied machine learning, and social simulations to understand these complex phenomena.
