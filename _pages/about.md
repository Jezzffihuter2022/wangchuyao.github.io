I am a PhD researcher at the Department of Methodology London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), studying AI governance, political communication, and AI in social sciences using computational and experimental methods. I am affiliated with the LSE Data Science Institute and am Visiting at Department of Political Science, Yale University in 2025.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and society, particularly:
- AI governance and policy
- Political communication in the digital age
- Computational social science
- AI for social sciences
- Human-AI interaction and its societal impacts

I have authored 8 research papers, with publications in high-impact journals including *Nature Communications* (under review), *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications*, and manuscripts for *Nature Human Behaviour* and *PNAS Nexus*.

## Current Projects

I am currently working on understanding how AI systems shape public opinion and policy support, and the AI-human feedback loop. My work combines survey experiments, computational text analysis, and social simulations to examine these phenomena.
