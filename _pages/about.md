Welcome! I am a Ph.D. researcher in Social Research Methods at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), affiliated with the [LSE Data Science Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI). I am a Visiting Assistant in Research at Yale University's Department of Political Science. 

**I am now applying for Assistant Professor and postdoctoral positions beginning in 2026.**

I am a researcher at the intersection of AI governance, political communication, and computational social science. I examine how strategies and generative AI jointly shape public perception, political expression, and policy support, often producing unintended consequences. To investigate these dynamics, I combine human-AI interation, survey experiment, computational text and image analysis, and social network analysis.

I have authored 8 papers, all published, under review, or in preparation for leading journals. These includes my [job market paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16202) under review at *Nature Communications*, and a [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-04350-1) in *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications* (Nature Portfolio). As Principal Investigator, I have secured competitive research grants from LSE, OpenAI, Google, and Social Science Research Council (USA). 

I taught courses in politics, media, and quantitative methods, with formal pedagogical training and excellent teaching evaluations.
