Welcome! I am a Ph.D. researcher in Social Research Methods at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), affiliated with the [LSE Data Science Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/DSI). I am a Visiting Assistant in Research at Yale University's Department of Political Science. 

**I am now applying for Assistant Professor and postdoctoral positions beginning in 2026.**

I am a researcher at the intersection of AI governance, political communication, and computational social science. Substantively, I examine how state strategies and generative AI jointly affect citizens’ perceptions of political information, constrain political expression, and influence policy preferences. These processes can produce unintended consequences across both authoritarian and democratic regimes. Methodologically, I combine human-AI interaction, survey experiments, computational text and image analysis, and social network analysis.

I have authored 8 papers, all published, under review, or in preparation for leading journals. These include my [job market paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16202) under review at *Nature Communications*, and a [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-04350-1) in *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications* (Nature Portfolio). I am working on a paper targeting *PNAS*, supported by grants from LSE, OpenAI, and Google, alongside additional studies in progress for leading political science journals.

I taught courses in politics, media, and quantitative methods, with formal pedagogical training and excellent teaching evaluations.

My CV is [here](/files/ChuyaoWANG_LSE_CV.pdf). Please feel free to contact me at c.wang85@lse.ac.uk.
