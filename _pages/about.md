I am a PhD researcher in the Department of Methodology at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). I am affiliated with the LSE Data Science Institute and visiting at Yale University's Department of Political Science in 2025.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on:
- AI governance and policy
- Political communication in the digital age  
- Computational social science
- Applications of AI in social sciences
- Human-AI interaction and its sociopolitical impacts

I have authored or co-authored 8 research papers, including publications in *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications* (Nature Portfolio), with manuscripts under review at *Nature Communications*, *Nature Human Behaviour*, and *PNAS Nexus*.

I have secured competitive grants from LSE, OpenAI, and Google as the Principal Investigator. I strive to achieve excellence in teaching, mentorship, and service.

## Current Projects

My current work investigates how AI systems shape public opinion and policy support, focusing on human-AI feedback loops. I employ survey experiments, computational text analysis, applied machine learning and social simulations to understand these complex phenomena.
