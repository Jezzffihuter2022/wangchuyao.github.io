I have a strong track record of securing competitive grants and awards, having received a total amount of US$1,050,000. This demonstrates the broad appeal and real-world relevance of my research, and my ability to communicate its significance to varied stakeholders. With several high-impact projects underway, I am well-positioned to attract further support for my research program.
