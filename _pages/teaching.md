Teaching, to me, is not only the transmission of knowledge but also the cultivation of conceptual agility, analytical rigor and reflective judgment. I view education as a transformative process that equips students to reason across disciplines, interpret plural epistemologies, and act with confidence in their pursuits.

I integrate real-world examples, responsible use of generative AI, and flipped classroom approaches with up-to-date materials. I design content responsive to students' varied academic backgrounds, drawing on my own interdisciplinary journey. I encourage social science students to learn advanced research methods through conceptually grounded, narrative-based approaches.

I have taught 3 undergraduate and postgraduate courses across 7 terms in social sciences and quantitative methods, receiving formal pedagogical training and achieving excellent teaching evaluation scores: **5.00, 4.91, and 5.00 (out of 5)**
