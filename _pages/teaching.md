I approach teaching as a process of equipping students with conceptual clarity, analytical precision, and critical openness.

Specifically, I use real-world case studies, arrange flipped classrooms, and alow responsible use of generative AI tools to foster interactive learning. I tailor course content for students from diverse academic and cultural backgrounds. I also emphasize conceptually grounded approaches to research methods.

I have taught **3 postgraduate and undergraduate courses across 7 terms** in social sciences and quantitative methods, receiving formal pedagogical training and acheived excellent teaching evaluation scores: **5.00, 4.91, and 5.00 (out of 5)**.
