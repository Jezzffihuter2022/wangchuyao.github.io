Teaching, to me, is not only the transmission of knowledge but also the cultivation of conceptual agility, analytical rigor, and reflective judgment. I view education as a transformative process that equips students to reason across disciplines, interpret plural epistemologies, and act with confidence in their pursuits.

I embrace interactive teaching by integrating up-to-date examples, encouraging students' responsible use of generative AI, and flipped classroom approaches. To accommodate studentsâ€™ diverse academic and cultrual backgrounds, I design course content that is both flexible and grounded, drawing on my interdisciplinary training across history, social science, and computational methods. In particular, I encourage social science students to approach advanced research methods through conceptually grounded, narrative-based learning, which helps bridge abstract techniques and real-world applications.

I have taught **3 undergraduate and postgraduate courses across 7 terms** in social sciences and quantitative methods, receiving formal pedagogical training and have consistently acheived excellent teaching evaluation scores: **5.00, 4.91, and 5.00 (out of 5)**.
